// This performs memory registration for RDMA Rendezvous when PSM3_RDMA enabled
// Priority registration calls ere those immediately before the data transfer
// hence delaying their registration directly delays IOs.
// Non-priority calls are those registering the whole IO
// prior to sending/receiving the CTS.  Delays in non-priority
// calls have less direct impacts on IO delays.
// Numbers and size limits for priority registrations are able to be directly
// estimated since limits on outstanding RDMAs and their size constrains them.
// Non-priority registrations and sizes are a function of application design
// and how many conurrent MPI_ISend/IRecv are outstanding and of what size.
// Given defaults, priority registrations limits will be 160 entries of
// 128K each for a total of < 20MB of the kernel cache.
// All non-priority registrations eventually get used for IOs and become
// a priority use case, so attempting to track whether each entry in the cache
// is a priority or non-priority entry is tricky, especially since there
// can be both priority and non-priority references.  So instead of attempting
// to track the amount of priority and non-priority entries, we simply
// track current inuse entries and only allow non-priority registrations when
// we have a reasonable amount of headroom.  This way most priority
// registrations will succeed.
